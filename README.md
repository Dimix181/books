# books

This is a repo for books I have read lately.

A bit about me because this list is probably best for people who can relate to my enjoyments

I am a programmer/entrepreneur, and this list is for other people who generally fit that bill. I'm also a 28 y/o white male who lives in New York City and grew up in Canada. I'm quite socially liberal, but I usually don't read books to affirm or deny those kinds of beliefs. Lately I have mostly read to learn about the world or become a better entrepreneur, but I'm always on the lookout for a good fiction book I may enjoy. I mostly consume via audiobook.

### This is the first draft of the repo
#### Will provide more insight for each book later.

#### First draft. These are not all *strong* recommendations, but none of these suck

- [Money Ball](http://a.co/9yaobYC), [The Big Short](http://a.co/1BLahTe), [Flash Boys](http://a.co/9P5nogr ) <- Read these back-to-back-to-back. This was fun. You could probably mix in any of [Michael Lewis](https://www.amazon.com/Michael-Lewis/e/B000APZ33E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1)â€™ other books as well.
- [The Victorian Internet](http://a.co/1BCir5O )
- [Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet](http://a.co/eKMI4yj)<- Kind of like a sequal to [The Victorian Internet](http://a.co/1BCir5O ). Fun to read back-to-back.
